00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Starting from the product list, we'll select the "Customizable Desk 80cmW".

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
On the product form, let's navigate to the "Attributes & Variants" tab.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Here, we can see that the product is configurable by Metal Color, which corresponds to the color of the legs from a different product that will be used.
Next is Size, which describes the Desktop's dimensions. Note that the width and height remain the same for all sizes.
Finally, Thickness values correspond to the various Melamine Board thicknesses.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now, let's go back and examine a component, the "Metal Legs".

5
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,500
We'll check its "Attributes & Variants" tab as well.

6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,000
These legs can be customized by width and color, including a custom color option.

7
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Next, we'll return to the list and look at the "Desk Top" component.

8
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's open its "Attributes & Variants" to see how it's defined.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This desk top is manufactured from the melamine boards that we will see later and has variants for color, thickness, and various dimensions.
The Desktop Size consists of length and width. Notice that we have values for two different widths, 70 centimeters and 80 centimeters, that will apply to the respective final products.

10
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's go back and examine the raw material, the "Melamine Classic board".

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
On the product form, we can see the unit of measure is set per board, but other units are available.
For example, our custom unit of measure; board with different dimensions, square meters, etc.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,500
Now, let's check the "Attributes & Variants" for this raw material.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The raw board itself has attributes for different colors and thicknesses.

14
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,500
After that, we will proceed to the BoM rules, accessible from the Products menu.
